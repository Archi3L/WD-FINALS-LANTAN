      Yuno, Asta’s childhood rival and best friend, is a prodigy blessed with immense magical talent and noble lineage. 
      As a bearer of the Four-Leaf Clover Grimoire and host of the wind spirit Sylph, Yuno is known for his calm demeanor and sharp intellect. 
      Later, he inherits Star Magic from his royal Spade Kingdom bloodline, combining elegance and overwhelming power. 
      His unwavering resolve to claim the title of Wizard King puts him on a parallel path of destiny beside Asta.
